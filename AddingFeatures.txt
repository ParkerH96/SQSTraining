2. Select a feature and, using the download icon, download the PHP file that is running that feature.

3. Change the downloaded PHP file to the customized way you want the new feature to run

   This is where you change the PHP to display/function the way you want the feature to display/function

4. After the PHP file is finished, Click the Add Feature button at the top of the page. This will bring you to a pop to fill in the feature information

   This is where you will give your feature a name (Recommended to use current naming convention), give a description of how the feature changes the page,
   Upload the PHP you just finished editing and give the feature a Target.

      Target: The place where this feature will show. So if you are creating a feature to changed the way the Name Display works then you would want to target 'namedisplay'
